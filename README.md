# 3D_Agent_based_Social_Force_Behavior_Model

3D Virtual arena showing how agents react to social force behavior model.

The brown boxes are hurdles and the blue boxes move from a start point to a destination point.
Each box is an agent and has a field of repulsion around its vicinity. This allows the movers to not hit on other objects or movers when it gets close.

The camera can be rotated in the arena, holding left mouse button and right mouse button. It can be moved through arrow keys.
The camera can also be fixed on top any moving object and see what is happening around it.

To imitate the field of repulsion, I used a gaussian function
